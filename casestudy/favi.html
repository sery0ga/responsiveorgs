<h3 id="roles--structure">Roles / Structure</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>FAVI is divided to 21 _mini-factories_. There are 5 service factories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Commercial</li>
      <li>Studies</li>
      <li>Laboratory</li>

    <p>Each production factory is in direct relation with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a client (Fiat, Citroën, Volkswagen...)</li>
      <li>a sector of activity (water meters, rotors...)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>"[If] a client would develop in a new activity large enough we would create a
specific mini factory for that client"</i>, writes Jean-Francois Zobrist</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4> Mini-factory</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>Each mini-factory is composed of 20-35 operators. It is physically co-located,
has own identity (floor and machine colour, logo) and has an elected leader.</p>

    <p>Mini-factory is autonomous and responsible for planning, production and sale of
its services or products.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
      Orders arrive directly in the shop floor, are
executed and only after go back to administrative department for treatment

  </div>
</div>

<h4>Team Leader</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>The leaders are elected by mini-factory members and are always former operators.
The leaders are equal to operators and stay with them. Their responsibilities
include but not limited to: security and health at work, salaries and their
increase, definition of hiring needs, welcome and follow-up of newcomers,
training and investment plans.</p>

    <p>Though it may seem like a traditional manager but the difference is huge:
      <ul>
        <li>the leaders don't tell operators what to do and how to do their job</li>
        <li>the leaders take an administrative burden</li>
        <li>the leaders make all important decision with their teams</li>
        <li>operators could vote with their feet and leave a leader they don't like</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>At the same time the leaders don't need to report to anyone except their operators
and clients. They choose themselves which indicators they wish to follow.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <b>His goal</b>: maintain the existing jobs thanks to a permanent progress systemic
        implementation in the social, societal, economic and environmental fields.
        <br/>

        <b>His sanction</b>: loose business and staff due to his lack of creativeness or
        reactivity.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4>The Merchant / The Sales Representative</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        The merchant's role is to bring the outside in, by conveying the maximum
        information from the customer to his/hers operators, on the strategy,
        new products, changes, etc. And vice versa to pass information from the
        mini-plants back to the client. This is done usually formally during a
        monthly meeting of the mini-plant where the merchant provides all information
        of the new client, and vice versa by informal tours through the mini-plants.
        Sometimes the merchant calls the customer to come directly to the operators
        to explain a particular point. Whenever possible the merchant puts all associates
        of his/hers mini-plant in a car and goes with them to the customer.
    </div>
    <p>The sales representatives have no rewards, no premiums, no objectives and no
    reports to do. There is only a pressure from the client. They may contact
    internal experts about particular issues or CEO about new business but it's up
    to them to make a final decision.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
      <b>His goal</b>: create jobs with human and financial added value
      <br/>
      <b>His sanction</b>: have to fire some employees

<h4>CEO</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
      [CEO] is a bit like the electron of the hydrogen atom: alone, everywhere and
      nowhere. But as he should not take offence [...] we put him in the interface
      between the INSIDE and the OUTSIDE, listening to the weak signals, internal
      as well as external. He is permanently trying to "FEEL" the process as well
      as the environment to help us detect pitfalls and opportunities.

<h3>Decision-Making</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>On one hand the leaders and the sales representatives have a lot of decision-making
  power. On the other hand the decision process is deeply <a href="/approaches.html#decision-process">advisory</a>.
  Jean-Francous Zobrist, ex-CEO, formed an environment where everyone seeks for
  an advice as soon as they can't find a solution acceptable for all stakeholders.</p>

    <p>I believe the story below describe the process best of all. You will find another
  one <a href="#investments--budgets">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Story of the temporary workers we kept</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
      <p>1990, first gulf war. Demand crisis, drop of quantity of orders</p>
      <p>We had step by step reduced the production, used the opportunity of the lower
    activity to paint, clean, order, accelerate the training plans, but around
    February-March these measures were not sufficient any more.</p>

      <p>We were at that time around 300 and employed as well around 30 temporary workers.
    Temporary work has always been for us the preliminary step to full employment,
    and a way to adapt to the numerous constraints of our laws. Usually, temporary
    workers had two contracts of three months, after what the best were offered
    a one year contract within the frame of the laws at that time: integration
    contract, qualifying contract...</p>

      <p>This system allowed us to have an 18 months trial period before to sign an
    unlimited working contract. In France, this unlimited working contract is more
    binding than a wedding contract as it is easier to divorce than to end a working
    contract with an employee.</p>

      <p>These eighteen months were structured with programmed integration steps according
    to our document <b>"Integration of new workers"</b>.</p>

      <p>So to manage the lower activity, not knowing what to do, I decided to gather
    the entire staff to search for a solution together. They had prepared for me
    a podium with empty pallets and I exposed to the tribe the current situation,
    what had already been done, the extremely high level of stock and I concluded
    explaining that we had around thirty temporary workers from whom we could resign
    very easily, but that it was a very sad decision, and a sort of discrimination for
    these young boys and girls who we wanted to integrate as new collaborators.</p>

      <p>A game of questions and answers started among the different possible solutions
    and at a certain moment, Gerard, an operator in his fifties asked: <b>"And if we
    stopped to work one week without being paid, could we keep temporary workers
    longer?"</b></p>

      <p>I answered that yes, it could allow us to keep them longer, maybe one month,
    maybe more, we had to calculate. This would allow us to wait for the end of the
    crisis, that would of course come, as we all knew that a demand crisis based on
    collective fear never last long.</p>

      <p>After this debate, I proposed to the entire staff to vote. At my stupefaction
    <b>all hands went up</b>!</p>

      <p>I decided to stop production for a week, everyone would stay at home, except
    management and middle management who would work without salary during that week,
    being understood that when activity would come back, we would work back full
    Saturdays to recover the lost salaries.</p>

      <p>This was done in the following months.</p>

<h4> Salary Increases (by Jean-Francois Zobrist)</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>As within our system the leader decides for operators, the oldest sales manager
for the youngest, well always someone working 8 hours per day directly in
contact with his team, there was never any claim that came back to me, even for those getting 0%!</p>

    <p>This notion of quiet friendly consensus is very important in terms of productivity
because nothing costs more than rumours like:</p>

    <p>"As usual, the boss is always supporting sales department!"</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>"It is always foundry that is allowed to invest!"</p>
    <p>This kind of rumour costs 4 to 5 points of productivity all the time it is running.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3> Investments / Budgets</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>Each year in September I send a message to everyone reminding our company strategy and I propose that everyone, within his field and work position, think over the investments to do the following year in terms of comfort, safety, health at work, respect of the environment, quality, productivity and all this without defining a financial limit to foster creativity.</p>
    <p>Each Mini-factory with the support of its productivity godfather and leader defines a workgroup to elaborate the investment budget.
In November all this work is coming back to me. We sort between costs and investment and 8 times out of 10 the global amount is possible, so the plans of each mini-factory are accepted without any discussion!</p>
    <p>We can also notice that 10 times out of 10 at the end of the budget year only 80% of forecasts have been achieved. And this only because Man being naturally good, what was in good faith forecasted a few months before seemed finally unnecessary according to the current financial year realization.
2 times out of 10 then the amount asked seems to me unreasonable. In this case I gather all the managers and tell them: "You asked me for 12 but I truly believe that we can not reasonably do more than 10."</p>
    <p>Then a meeting between leaders is organized and by "bargaining" a natural consensus is reached among all guided by their global knowledge of the investment plan that they did not have beforehand.</p>
    <p>This allows in good faith and with good will to grant priority to what serves best the collective interest.</p>
  </div>

<h3> Performance Evaluation</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
One day, an automotive client, "square", comes to make a logistics audit. During the opening meeting, two engineers, a man and a woman, senior, tell me that they will stay for three days. However, after half a day they ask to meet me. They come with very disturbed faces and signs of anger:
- "It is not going well at all! We have never seen this! There are no indicators to follow delays, no indicators to follow shortages, you have no structure, no planning department, no launching department, no scheduling, no management of delays, no service level follow-up for your clients... Well it is incredible that you are first tier supplier and you can expect to receive sanctions and to be put into question as our supplier!"
I answered them:
- "According to your files, for how long do we supply 100% of your needs?" Auditors check their records and answer:
- "11 years"
- "Did we in 11 years deliver one time late?"
- "No"
- "In advance?"
- "No"
While checking their files...
- "In 11 years did we delivered one time not enough quantity?"
- "No"
- "Too many pieces?"
- "As well no..."
"So why do you expect me to implement indicators following something that does not exist?"
Answer: "..."
In the meantime I had drawn on papers all the indicators they wanted, all showing a beautiful line at zero and I gave them the sheets saying:
- "Now, if you wish, every month we will send you updated tables like those, and I really expect they will remain identical to these ones!"
  </div>
