      <p>FAVI has been awarded in 1997 the fist European foundry to be certified ISO 14001,
      in 2000, the first French company to be certified OHSAS 18001, in 2002 the
      first French company to be certified Q.S.E. and in 2008 the first European foundry
      to be certified ILO-OSH 2001.</p>

      <p>FAVI has an astonishing record of 0 delivery delays for 30 years (since 1984).
      It has reduced the cost of producing a gearbox fork by 40% in real terms over
      two decades. It survived on a market where all its competitors outsource their
      production to China to reduce costs.</p>

      <p>FAVI is divided to 21 <b>mini-factories</b>. There are 5 service factories:</p>

  <h4> Mini-factory</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>Each mini-factory is composed of 20-35 operators. It is physically co-located,
  has own identity (floor and machine colour, logo) and has an elected leader.</p>

      <p>Mini-factory is autonomous and responsible for planning, production and sale of
  its services or products.</p>

  <h4>Team Leader</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>The leaders are elected by mini-factory members and are always former operators.
  The leaders are equal to operators and stay with them. Their responsibilities
  include but not limited to: security and health at work, salaries and their
  increase, definition of hiring needs, welcome and follow-up of newcomers,
  training and investment plans.</p>

      <p>Though it may seem like a traditional manager but the difference is huge:
        <ul>
          <li>the leaders don't tell operators what to do and how to do their job</li>
          <li>the leaders take an administrative burden</li>
          <li>the leaders make all important decision with their teams</li>
          <li>operators could vote with their feet and leave a leader they don't like</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>At the same time the leaders don't need to report to anyone except their operators
  and clients. They choose themselves which indicators they wish to follow.</p>

          <b>Leader's goal</b>: maintain the existing jobs thanks to a permanent progress systemic
          implementation in the social, societal, economic and environmental fields.

          <b>Leader's sanction</b>: loose business and staff due to his lack of creativeness or
          reactivity.

  <h4>The Merchant / The Sales Representative</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
          The merchant's role is to bring the outside in, by conveying the maximum
          information from the customer to his/hers operators, on the strategy,
          new products, changes, etc. And vice versa to pass information from the
          mini-plants back to the client. This is done usually formally during a
          monthly meeting of the mini-plant where the merchant provides all information
          of the new client, and vice versa by informal tours through the mini-plants.
          Sometimes the merchant calls the customer to come directly to the operators
          to explain a particular point. Whenever possible the merchant puts all associates
          of his/hers mini-plant in a car and goes with them to the customer.
      </div>
      <p>The sales representatives have no rewards, no premiums, no objectives and no
      reports to do. There is only a pressure from the client. They may contact
      internal experts about particular issues or CEO about new business but it's up
      to them to make a final decision.</p>

        [CEO] is a bit like the electron of the hydrogen atom: alone, everywhere and

        between the INSIDE and the OUTSIDE, listening to the weak signals, internal
        as well as external. He is permanently trying to "FEEL" the process as well
        as the environment to help us detect pitfalls and opportunities.

      <p>All information in FAVI is available to everyone though it's not imposed.
      The annual balanced sheet and the monthly financial reports are open to everyone.
      Employees are trained to read financial data.</p>

      <p>There is the "FAVI information file" which is published monthly since 1983.
      It covers such topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>business trips</b> (dates, companies, persons concerned)</li>
        <li><b>visits</b> (dates, hour, company and reason)</li>
        <li><b>meetings</b> (dates, hour, subject)</li>
        <li><b>divers</b> (a section where everyone could express themselves, ask
        question and provide any information they find important)</li>
        <li><b>client information</b></li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The information file is present on the intranet and on electronic tables
      in each mini-factory</p>
      <p>The <b>merchants</b> share all available information about clients with the
      operators on regular basis. It's common for operators to visit client's factories
      to see how their components are used in products.</p>

      <p>On one hand the leaders and the sales representatives have a lot of decision-making
    power. On the other hand the decision process is deeply <a href="/approaches.html#decision-process">advisory</a>.
    Jean-Francois Zobrist, ex-CEO, formed an environment where everyone seeks for
    an advice as soon as they can't find a solution acceptable for all stakeholders.</p>

  <h4>Story of the temporary workers we kept</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        <p>1990, first gulf war. Demand crisis, drop of quantity of orders</p>
        <p>We had step by step reduced the production, used the opportunity of the lower
      activity to paint, clean, order, accelerate the training plans, but around
      February-March these measures were not sufficient any more.</p>

        <p>We were at that time around 300 and employed as well around 30 temporary workers.
      Temporary work has always been for us the preliminary step to full employment,
      and a way to adapt to the numerous constraints of our laws. Usually, temporary
      workers had two contracts of three months, after what the best were offered
      a one year contract within the frame of the laws at that time: integration
      contract, qualifying contract...</p>

        <p>This system allowed us to have an 18 months trial period before to sign an
      unlimited working contract. In France, this unlimited working contract is more
      binding than a wedding contract as it is easier to divorce than to end a working
      contract with an employee.</p>

        <p>These eighteen months were structured with programmed integration steps according
      to our document <b>"Integration of new workers"</b>.</p>

        <p>So to manage the lower activity, not knowing what to do, I decided to gather
      the entire staff to search for a solution together. They had prepared for me
      a podium with empty pallets and I exposed to the tribe the current situation,
      what had already been done, the extremely high level of stock and I concluded
      explaining that we had around thirty temporary workers from whom we could resign
      very easily, but that it was a very sad decision, and a sort of discrimination for
      these young boys and girls who we wanted to integrate as new collaborators.</p>

        <p>A game of questions and answers started among the different possible solutions
      and at a certain moment, Gerard, an operator in his fifties asked: <b>"And if we
      stopped to work one week without being paid, could we keep temporary workers
      longer?"</b></p>

        <p>I answered that yes, it could allow us to keep them longer, maybe one month,
      maybe more, we had to calculate. This would allow us to wait for the end of the
      crisis, that would of course come, as we all knew that a demand crisis based on
      collective fear never last long.</p>

        <p>After this debate, I proposed to the entire staff to vote. At my stupefaction
      <b>all hands went up</b>!</p>

        <p>I decided to stop production for a week, everyone would stay at home, except
      management and middle management who would work without salary during that week,
      being understood that when activity would come back, we would work back full
      Saturdays to recover the lost salaries.</p>

        <p>This was done in the following months.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>Salary increases are a tension point in many organisations. In FAVI the leaders
    are responsible for that and they do their job very well. The system doesn't
    allow to do it in any other way as operators could easily leave leaders they do
    not like.</p>

        <p>As within our system the leader decides for operators, the oldest sales manager
    for the youngest, well always someone working 8 hours per day directly in
    contact with his team, there was never any claim that came back to me, even for those getting 0%!</p>

        <p>This notion of quiet friendly consensus is very important in terms of productivity
    because nothing costs more than rumours like:</p>

        <p>"As usual, the boss is always supporting sales department!"</p>
        <p>or</p>

      <p>Investments in FAVI are handed to operators to decide on. They do it yearly
      and the process is perfectly described in the story below</p>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success">
        <p>Each year in September I send a message to everyone reminding our company strategy and I propose that everyone, within his field and work position, think over the investments to do the following year in terms of comfort, safety, health at work, respect of the environment, quality, productivity and all this without defining a financial limit to foster creativity.</p>
        <p>Each Mini-factory with the support of its productivity godfather and leader defines a workgroup to elaborate the investment budget.
    In November all this work is coming back to me. We sort between costs and investment and 8 times out of 10 the global amount is possible, so the plans of each mini-factory are accepted without any discussion!</p>
        <p>We can also notice that 10 times out of 10 at the end of the budget year only 80% of forecasts have been achieved. And this only because Man being naturally good, what was in good faith forecasted a few months before seemed finally unnecessary according to the current financial year realization.
    2 times out of 10 then the amount asked seems to me unreasonable. In this case I gather all the managers and tell them: "You asked me for 12 but I truly believe that we can not reasonably do more than 10."</p>
        <p>Then a meeting between leaders is organized and by "bargaining" a natural consensus is reached among all guided by their global knowledge of the investment plan that they did not have beforehand.</p>
        <p>This allows in good faith and with good will to grant priority to what serves best the collective interest.</p>

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>FAVI has a basic salary and yearly bonuses. Yearly bonuses are 7% of the
      profit before tax shared equally between everyone.</p>
      <p>Salary increases depend on the <a href="#performance-evaluation">performance</a>
      and the performance only. The leaders are responsible for the increases.</p>

      <p>FAVI has no controlling systems in place based on multiple indicators
      or parameters. There are a set of <a href="#values">values</a> that everyone
      should keep in mind seeking LOVE of their clients and colleagues.</p>

      <p>Your salary increase depends on your performance and the leaders are trusted
      to make this decision. The leaders work 8 hours a day with you and know really
      well how you work. It's very important to remind here that the leaders
      <i>serve</i>, not <i>manage</i> operators. They exist to help operators be happy
      and productive and they have no incentive to demotivate operators by keeping
      a deserved salary increase.</p>

      <p>However the leaders are humans and not protected from making a mistake. In
      such case an operator or his colleagues could raise this question on a regular
      meeting.</p>

      <p>The absence of any controlling system in place is so shocking for many
      traditional managers that Jean-Francois has a number of funny stories related
      to this fact. The one of them is below.</p>

      <div class="alert alert-success">
        <p>One day, an automotive client, "square", comes to make a logistics audit. During the opening meeting, two engineers, a man and a woman, senior, tell me that they will stay for three days. However, after half a day they ask to meet me. They come with very disturbed faces and signs of anger:</p>
        <p><i>- It is not going well at all! We have never seen this! There are no indicators to follow delays, no indicators to follow shortages, you have no structure, no planning department, no launching department, no scheduling, no management of delays, no service level follow-up for your clients... Well it is incredible that you are first tier supplier and you can expect to receive sanctions and to be put into question as our supplier!</i></p>
        <p>I answered them:</p>
        <p><i>- According to your files, for how long do we supply 100% of your needs?</i>
        <p>Auditors check their records and answer:</p>
        <p><i>- 11 years</i></p>
        <p><i>- Did we in 11 years deliver one time late?</i></p>
        <p><i>- No</i></p>
        <p><i>- In advance?</i></p>
        <p><i>- No</i></p>
        <p>While checking their files...</p>
        <p><i>- In 11 years did we delivered one time not enough quantity?</i></p>
        <p><i>- No</i></p>
        <p><i>- Too many pieces?</i></p>
        <p><i>- As well no...</i></p>
        <p><i>- So why do you expect me to implement indicators following something that does not exist?</i></p>
        <p>Answer: <i>"..."</i>
        <p>In the meantime I had drawn on papers all the indicators they wanted, all showing a beautiful line at zero and I gave them the sheets saying:</p>
        <p><i>- Now, if you wish, every month we will send you updated tables like those, and I really expect they will remain identical to these ones!</i></p>

      <p>There is no HR department in FAVI. It's up to mini-factories to find
      and teach new members. Their initiation period is much longer than the process
      of interviews as they hire a person only after a substantial period of joint
      work.</p>
      <p>It all starts with a leader who defines the specifications of a person
      needed. After that they get support from <a href="#roles">Administration</a>
      factory to filter candidates.</p>
      <p>As soon as a newcomer is chosen and made a visit to the factory, a newcomer
      becomes a temp worker. She gets a lot of attention form her leader, productivity
      godfather and others.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>Somewhere before the end of the first month the newcomer has to make
      a moral commitment to stay at FAVI for the next 6 months. The commitment is
      written but it has no legal power, that's why it's a moral one. Only after the
      commitment he takes part in "5 days" training. The training covers FAVI
      culture, services and tools for production, FAVI's products and quality, safety
      and environment improvements.</p>
      <p>After the initiation period (which lasts 6 months) the applicant must
      write a letter where she explains why she want to enter the FAVI family
      and how she expects to contribute. There's no rules for such letters. However,
      the content is often very rich and personal.</p>
      <p>Jean-Francois explains this process terrifically:</p>

        A profitable company is always unstable. Markets are unstable. Legal
        environment is unstable. If we want to succeed, at least the commitment
        of everyone to the tribe must be stable.

  <h3 id="firing">Firing</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>In FAVI they never let someone on the side of the road. The only reason an
      associate could be fired immediately is he/she acts against <a href="#values">
      the values</a>.</p>
      <p>To prove this point only one employee left the company during its transformation
      from a traditional company with 8 layers of hierarchy to the current one.</p>
      <p>As usual Jean-Francois has a story to share:</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success">
        <p>In 33 years of my career I fired only three workers:</p>
        <ul><li>A manager in 1985 who had not been sincere</li>
            <li>A quality agent in 1990 who had faked control documents</li>
            <li>Last month an operator who had modified the programs of a machining equipment to increase the speed at the risk of producing bad pieces for VW. And all this to get 1/2 an hour of spare time by shift.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However I will never and I never did sanction a worker who did a
        mistake, whatever its cost, because only those doing nothing or trying
        nothing do not make mistakes.</p>

  <h3 id="work-schedule">Work Schedule</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I have no information on a vacation/sick days policy in FAVI. I believe their
      number are strictly regulated by French employment laws.</p>
      <p>However, the associates use common sense and freedom to organise their work
      to find best working schedule for everyone. There's a story of an associate
      who was building a house. He talked to his colleagues and temporary switched
      to night shifts getting premiums for a night job and helping with the house
      during the day. The operators made that decision on their own, without asking
      their leader for advice or permission. </p>

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>FAVI has a performance formula:</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>The performance comes from the operators!
        <br/>There is no performance without happiness!
        <br/>How can the operators be happy?</p>
      </div>
      <p>The performance is necessary for survival.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success">
        In a word, [operators] do a little bit more and a little better for a
        bit cheaper permanently.

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>FAVI invests massively in trainings. Some years they spend more than 10% of
      the total cost of manpower in training plans.</p>
      <p>These plans include trips to Japan for operators and leaders, trips generally
      prepared by a review of 5S, TPM, KAIZEN or any other progress tools, and
      implementation of improvement workshops.</p>
