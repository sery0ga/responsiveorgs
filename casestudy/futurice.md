### General
Futurice is an international service company working in a sphere of web and mobile
development. Its services include but not limited to concept and UX design, digital
strategy, mobile app development.

Futurice was founded in 2000 in Helsinki, Finland and right now has around 200 employees
in Helsinki, Tampere, Berlin, London and Lausanne. Futurice
[won](http://futurice.com/blog/a-kick-starter-for-sharing-futurices-culture-audit)
“The Best Place to Work in Europe” award twice in 2012 and 2013. Not only Futurice
grows smoothly from the very beginning but it’s also very profitable.
[Anni Kervinen](http://futurice.com/people/anni-kervinen), HR & Communication
specialist, [writes](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/14754391311322482),

    In 2011, the revenue was 11.6 million euros and the number of people leaving the company could be counted on the fingers of one hand. This compares to 9.5 million euros in 2010, and 7.7 million euros in 2009.

Futurice invests time, efforts and money into improvement of open source software
as they believe the world should be more open and transparent. They launched a
program called [Spice](http://www.spiceprogram.org/) to share their progress and results.

### Values
During the process of transformation (happened in 2007) four values emerged from the company-wide brainstorming:

- *Caring.* We care about people, customers and what we do. Customer problems are
our problems as well. There is never only one person to solve a problem but a group
of people finding a solution to challenges. The people of Futurice are always
considered as unique persons, not only employees.
- *Trust.* We have confidence in each other, as well as customers. Trust is not
something one has to earn first.
- *Continuous development.* We believe that everything can always be made better.
- *Transparency.* Knowledge is a privilege for everyone.

(from ["The decision to trust boosts performance"](link) by [Anni Kervinen](link))

As you can see two of the values - _trust_ and _transparency_ - are explicitly
identified basic principles common for all responsive organisations.

### Decision-making
_"Employees are granted the power to make the decisions that most affect themselves,
and remove any obstacles on their path without external assistance."_, writes
Markus Koljonen. However, they are encouraged to take an advice from everyone whom
the decision may concern.

Futurice developed [3x2 model](http://futurice.com/culture/the-3x2-model) which
is their implementation of [the advisory process](link).

    When moving towards a decision, a new project or an outsourcing task, there are three (3) times two (2) aspects to consider about its immediate and future impact: how does the decision affect your colleagues, the customer and the numbers, now and in the future.

A positive influence of the model is difficult to overestimate: from improvements
of working environment, decorations and toys to FutuClubit, the company's own radio station.

See: <a href="/approaches.html#decision-making" class="label label-primary">Advisory Process</a>

### Roles / Structure
Futurice consists of several tribes and service teams.

#### Tribes
_Tribe_ is a group of maximum 60 Futulainens united by the only principle - they want to work together.
The tribes are customer-oriented. All services provided by Futurice to its customers are provided by members of
the tribes. Each tribe is responsible for its P&L, employee engagement and professional improvement,
customer satisfaction and so on. In short, each tribe operates as a small company and as autonomously as possible from other tribes.

Being part of a tribe doesn't mean Futulainen doesn't work on projects with people
from other tribes. Futurice lives by its values: _[care about customer](#values)_
goes first and removes any destructive competition.

Each tribe has 3-4 leaders that were suggested and elected by members of the tribe.
The leaders are responsible for helping members of the tribe to do a great job and
keep the tribe successful and engaged. The leaders practice _lead and engage_
approach, not _command and control_. Their power is limited and Futulainens could
vote by their feet - if they don't like the tribe they could leave it any day.

Futulainens have traditionally-named position titles like "Design Lead" or
"Software Developer". I think the reason is that they work with many clients
with more traditional cultures and strict hierarchies and clearly defined titles
simplify collaboration.

Tribes are divided further to small teams up to 10 people. Each team has a (elected?)
team leader and a sales representative. The team is responsible for sales / customer
relationship development, project resourcing, management and human figures.
The team has a high degree of autonomy of their own business in terms of the
strategic direction of the framework. Such structure brings the team closer to
a customer and increases the speed of reaction to new opportunities/risks.

#### Service Teams
There are still some activities not covered. For example, _[continuous improvement](#values)_
or strategical planning on a company level. In addition, tribes could outsource
some activities like initial screening of applicants. This is where service teams
come into play.

### Information Flow
Futurice believes that people won't be able to make good decision themselves without open and truthful
communications. All information is available to everyone in the company and they constantly improve its quality:
not only people should know but they also should easily and clearly understand what the information conveys.

- All meetings are open. Everyone can join, listen and give an opinion
- Notes from weekly executives' meetings are shared with the whole staff
- Every month a report on financial performance is shared. It contains a lot of visual data to be easy to grasp.
- News about new hires, changes, projects and their statuses are delivered through Basecamp, Yammer, emails and face to face meetings.
- For internal conferences and events a video conference connection is set up. Presentation are recorded and available
on the intranet.

_FutuFriday_ is held every first Friday of a month and it's common for all locations. FutuFriday takes a whole day
and is devoted to learning, sharing and creating a spirit of Futurice. It consists of several sections including
PayDay Pizza, Speed Date with CEO, Pecha Kucha and others. At that day all Futulainens come to offices from clients'
locations to share news, talk to colleagues and have fun.

Walls in the offices are actively used to share news, emotions, values. There are

- _Strategy wall_ - an area on the kitchen wall where you can put your own ideas and wishes regarding the firm's strategy
- _Proud Wall_ - office has a wall space, where anybody can put prints and pictures of successful projects, and other
topics of pride.
- _QualityTime_ - Quality Assurance Newsletter which is placed in toilets and gained wide popularity.
- and many others.

There's Micro Communication Team which is responsible for promotion and development of internal communication across
the enterprise. Its activities include blog writing, communication trainings, FutuFriday concept development.

### Personal Development
Futurice has, probably, the most impressive and well-developed program for personal growth. However it shouldn't surprise
you as it's completely in line with one of their [values](#values). Futurice created a system which motivates and helps
you to learn and discover new things daily, stay aware of your progress and get support from your colleagues.

Futurice Career Carrier (FCC) program consists of four main elements:

- Career Path model
- Mentoring/Career Coaching
- MAD
- Weekly :)

**Career Path** is a long-term professional development plan created together with each employee.

To proceed faster in personal growth, every Futulainen may have a mentor. Mentor plays multiple roles: the traditional mentor,
coach, teacher, sparring partner (career and professional development) or work partner, as well as hugger, or a listener.
Mentors are not simply more experienced colleagues - they are trained on Mentor Camps to give you as much support as
possible.

In addition to a developed career path, Futulainens have weekly, monthly and semi-annually checkpoints. On semi-annually
checkpoints a Futulainen together with the mentor and the supervisor creates a long-term vision and objectives.
The mentor and the supervisor help to align the objectives with company's and team's strategy and vision, career
patterns and so on. If needed they add short-term milestones to the list. Both long- and short-term vision and objectives
are public thus enabling future support from other employees.

Monthly checkpoints are called **MAD (Monthly Anonymous Developer)** and held on [FutuFridays](#information--flow). It's
an one-hour meeting when each employee goes through the targets in a group of colleagues he considered best: team,
project team or competence area team. Futulainens answer four questions:

- What are the goals?
- What did I try to make last month?
- How was it developed and what did I learn?
- What will I try to make this month and how I think can it be?

**Weekly :)** --- [TODO]

Employees in Futurice run multiple internal conferences, trainings and workshops where everyone can learn or take part.
[3x2 model](link) motivates people to be proactive and organize trainings on topics not related to job at all. As
mentioned in [Investments](#investments--budgets) block, Futulainens can use their credit card for taking part in
conferences or courses.

Futurice has a dedicated team responsible for FCC and personal growth - HR Greenhouse micro team. They help to organize
trainings, improve learning facilities, set up functional communication channels and more.

### Investments / Budgets
Each Futulainen has a credit card for 5000 EUR which could be used without any approval. The approach increases the speed
of reaction and makes employees happier. The amount is large enough to handle easily all tactical issues and too small to sink the company.

For bigger amounts investments should be approved by (WHOM?). The process is pretty straight-forward and is regulated by [3x2 model](link).

### Hiring
Futurice has pretty formalized process with a sharp focus on fit by values. If
interviewers believe that a candidate doesn't fit the culture, they shake hands
and move apart on any step of the recruitment process.

Another important difference is that Futurice doesn't hire by needs. They have
established network of trusted contractors which are ready to help in case of
urgency. However, they won't hire anyone just to close a role.


Futurice's recruitment steps:

1. *Get to know* step. Run by HR and aimed to set up initial relationships with
a candidate
2. *Competence evaluation* step. Run by HR and aimed to understand a level of qualification
of a candidate. At this step the candidate decides which available team she wants
to join.
3. *Team interview* step. Run by team members (at least 3). A candidate gets homework
which is discussed at the interview.
4. *Career level and career plan* step. Run by supervisor and mentor and aimed
to create an initial realistic career plan.
5. *Final* step. Run by HR, aimed to close the recruitment process and at which
all required paper work is done.

### Onboarding
Futurice does it best to make a new employee a [...] member of the company. After
4 months of onboarding process a new employee should have a clear picture of the
company, know a lot of people, have a developed career plan and etc.

It all starts on the first day when a new employee meets her team, mentor, supervisor,
career coach, CEO and other random people. The employee is introduced [...]

Onboarding includes many training like financial education, information security,
intellectual property, quality. On first two months the employee also takes part
in several group sessions aimed to provide basic information about different
activities of the company, introduce new employees to each other and familiarize
with various professional disciplines.

During the onboarding process the employee has several interviews with HR, supervisor
and mentor to check current state and discuss how the things are going.

Last day of successful onboarding period is a team's celebration.

### Conflict Resolution
Futurice is built in a way that conflicts can be avoided at the outset or
their emergence could be detected in early stages before actual clashes and
unfavourable situations take place.

- common values and daily focus on everybody's well-being remove a lot of pressure
- job satisfaction is regularly monitored through monthly surveys
- *weekly :)* help to relieve bad feelings and invite employees to discuss problems
openly

Thanks to [3x2 model](#decision-making), employees are obliged to do their best to
find solution. Strong focus on autonomy and self-management significantly increase
the chance Futulainen resolves an issue himself.

However, sometimes conflicts couldn't be resolved one on one. For this purpose
a number of safety and support networks exists. Futulainen can contact:

- Mentor, supervisor or coach
- HR team which constantly communicate with employees to ensure it's very easy
to approach HR in difficult situation
- Safety representative elected by employees
- Supervisor of supervisor or CEO.

### Salary / Bonuses
Salary is based on your move along the career path which is discussed twice a
year on [checkpoints](#personal-development). Basically you move to the next level
if all your stakeholders - colleagues, clients, managers - are satisfied with
your work. Next level doesn't mean a next step in a common hierarchical ladder
_Developer -> Team Leader -> Project Manager -> Department Head_. Next level means
a wider sphere of your responsibilities. [give examples]

Bonuses are tied on the company's revenue and their structure depends on what
you want to pursue strategically each year. In addition to bonuses, employees could
buy the company's shares.

Criteria for financial rewarding are transparent and easily accessible. Futurice
aims to ensure that everyone understands how they can affect the success of the
company as an individual and how they mutually benefit from the success.

### Performance Evaluation
Your performance is evaluated regularly by your colleagues (see
[Personal Development](#personal-development)). It aims to provide you honest
feedback and help you to develop faster as a professional.

There are weekly and monthly meetings where you share your progress and your
colleagues share their opinions. This environment creates a very fast feedback
cycle and you have plenty of chances to learn and improve.

Good performance is important for moving to the next level on your career path.
However, it's evaluated holistically by everyone you work with - colleagues,
managers, mentors, clients and yourself.
