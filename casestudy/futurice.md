### General
Futurice is an international service company working in a sphere of web and mobile development. Its services include but not limited to concept and UX design, digital strategy, mobile app development.

Futurice was founded in 2000 in Helsinki, Finland and right now has around 200 employees in Helsinki, Tampere, Berlin, London and Lausanne. Futurice [won](http://futurice.com/blog/a-kick-starter-for-sharing-futurices-culture-audit) “The Best Place to Work in Europe” award twice in 2012 and 2013. Not only Futurice grows smoothly from the very beginning but it’s also very profitable. [Anni Kervinen](http://futurice.com/people/anni-kervinen), HR & Communication specialist, [writes](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/14754391311322482), "In 2011, the revenue was 11.6 million euros and the number of people leaving the company could be counted on the fingers of one hand. This compares to 9.5 million euros in 2010, and 7.7 million euros in 2009.”

Futurice invests time, efforts and money into improvement of open source software as they believe the world should be more open and transparent. They launched a program called [Spice](http://www.spiceprogram.org/) to share their progress and results.

### Values
During the process of transformation (happened in 2007) four values emerged from the company-wide brainstorming:

- *Caring.* We care about people, customers and what we do. Customer problems are our problems as well. There is never only one person to solve a problem but a group of people finding a solution to challenges. The people of Futurice are always considered as unique persons, not only employees.
- *Trust.* We have confidence in each other, as well as customers. Trust is not something one has to earn first.
- *Continuous development.* We believe that everything can always be made better.
- *Transparency.* Knowledge is a privilege for everyone.

(from ["The decision to trust boosts performance"](link) by [Anni Kervinen](link))

As you can see two of the values - _trust_ and _transparency_ - are explicitly identified basic principles common for all responsive organisations.

### Decision-making
_"Employees are granted the power to make the decisions that most affect themselves, and remove any obstacles on their path without external assistance."_, writes Markus Koljonen. However, they are encouraged to take an advice from everyone whom the decision may concern.

Futurice developed [3x2 model](http://futurice.com/culture/the-3x2-model) which is their implementation of [the advisory process](link).

    When moving towards a decision, a new project or an outsourcing task, there are three (3) times two (2) aspects to consider about its immediate and future impact: how does the decision affect your colleagues, the customer and the numbers, now and in the future.

A positive influence of the model is difficult to overestimate: from improvements of working environment, decorations and toys to FutuClubit, the company's own radio station.

### Roles / Structure
Futurice consists of several tribes and service teams.

#### Tribes
_Tribe_ is a group of maximum 60 Futulainens united by the only principle - they want to work together.
The tribes are customer-oriented. All services provided by Futurice to its customers are provided by members of
the tribes. Each tribe is responsible for its P&L, employee engagement and professional improvement,
customer satisfaction and so on. In short, each tribe operates as a small company and as autonomously as possible from other tribes.

Being part of a tribe doesn't mean Futulainen doesn't work on projects with people from other tribes. Futurice lives by its values: _[care about customer](#values)_ goes first and removes any destructive competition.

Each tribe has 3-4 leaders that were suggested and elected by members of the tribe. The leaders are responsible for helping members of the tribe to do a great job and keep the tribe successful and engaged. The leaders practice _lead and engage_ approach, not _command and control_. Their power is limited and Futulainens could vote by their feet - if they don't like the tribe they could leave it any day.

Futulainens have traditionally-named position titles like "Design Lead" or "Software Developer". I think the reason is that they work with many clients with more traditional cultures and strict hierarchies and clearly defined titles simplify collaboration.

Tribes are divided further to small teams up to 10 people. Each team has a (elected?) team leader and a sales representative. The team is responsible for sales / customer relationship development, project resourcing, management and human figures. The team has a high degree of autonomy of their own business in terms of the strategic direction of the framework. Such structure brings the team closer to a customer and increases the speed of reaction to new opportunities/risks.

#### Service Teams
There are still some activities not covered. For example, _[continuous improvement](#values)_ or strategical planning on a company level. In addition, tribes could outsource some activities like initial screening of applicants. This is where service teams come into play.

### Information Flow
Futurice believes that people won't be able to make good decision themselves without open and truthful
communications. All information is available to everyone in the company and they constantly improve its quality:
not only people should know but they also should easily and clearly understand what the information conveys.

- All meetings are open. Everyone can join, listen and give an opinion
- Notes from weekly executives' meetings are shared with the whole staff
- Every month a report on financial performance is shared. It contains a lot of visual data to be easy to grasp.
- News about new hires, changes, projects and their statuses are delivered through Basecamp, Yammer, emails and face to face meetings.
- For internal conferences and events a video conference connection is set up. Presentation are recorded and available
on the intranet.

_FutuFriday_ is held every first Friday of a month and it's common for all locations. FutuFriday takes a whole day
and is devoted to learning, sharing and creating a spirit of Futurice. It consists of several sections including
PayDay Pizza, Speed Date with CEO, Pecha Kucha and others. At that day all Futulainens come to offices from clients'
locations to share news, talk to colleagues and have fun.

Walls in the offices are actively used to share news, emotions, values. There are

- _Strategy wall_ - an area on the kitchen wall where you can put your own ideas and wishes regarding the firm's strategy
- _Proud Wall_ - office has a wall space, where anybody can put prints and pictures of successful projects, and other
topics of pride.
- _QualityTime_ - Quality Assurance Newsletter which is placed in toilets and gained wide popularity.
- and many others.

There's Micro Communication Team which is responsible for promotion and development of internal communication across
the enterprise. Its activities include blog writing, communication trainings, FutuFriday concept development.

### Personal Development
Futurice has, probably, the most impressive and well-developed program for personal growth. However it shouldn't surprise
you as it's completely in line with one of their [values](#values). Futurice created a system which motivates and helps
you to learn and discover new things daily, stay aware of your progress and get support from your colleagues.

Futurice Career Carrier (FCC) program consists of four main elements:

- Career Path model
- Mentoring/Career Coaching
- MAD
- Weekly :)

**Career Path** is a long-term professional development plan created together with each employee.

To proceed faster in personal growth, every Futulainen may have a mentor. Mentor plays multiple roles: the traditional mentor,
coach, teacher, sparring partner (career and professional development) or work partner, as well as hugger, or a listener.
Mentors are not simply more experienced colleagues - they are trained on Mentor Camps to give you as much support as
possible.

In addition to a developed career path, Futulainens have weekly, monthly and semi-annually checkpoints. On semi-annually
checkpoints a Futulainen together with the mentor and the supervisor creates a long-term vision and objectives.
The mentor and the supervisor help to align the objectives with company's and team's strategy and vision, career
patterns and so on. If needed they add short-term milestones to the list. Both long- and short-term vision and objectives
are public thus enabling future support from other employees.

Monthly checkpoints are called **MAD (Monthly Anonymous Developer)** and held on [FutuFridays](#information--flow). It's
an one-hour meeting when each employee goes through the targets in a group of colleagues he considered best: team,
project team or competence area team. Futulainens answer four questions:

- What are the goals?
- What did I try to make last month?
- How was it developed and what did I learn?
- What will I try to make this month and how I think can it be?

**Weekly :)** --- [TODO]

Employees in Futurice run multiple internal conferences, trainings and workshops where everyone can learn or take part.
[3x2 model](link) motivates people to be proactive and organize trainings on topics not related to job at all. As
mentioned in [Investments](#investments--budgets) block, Futulainens can use their credit card for taking part in
conferences or courses.

Futurice has a dedicated team responsible for FCC and personal growth - HR Greenhouse micro team. They help to organize
trainings, improve learning facilities, set up functional communication channels and more.

### Investments / Budgets
Each Futulainen has a credit card for 5000 EUR which could be used without any approval. The approach increases the speed
of reaction and makes employees happier. The amount is large enough to handle easily all tactical issues and too small to sink the company.

For bigger amounts investments should be approved by (WHOM?). The process is pretty straight-forward and is regulated by [3x2 model](link).
